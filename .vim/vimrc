" Philosophy
"
" * Strives for as much config as necessary but no more.  Adding more
" configuration makes issues harder to diagnose
" * This vimrc is not designed to be portable it assumes the latest stable
" gvim package (from arch linux) - E.g. it don't defensively check for features
" * Only change from default settings for the smallest scope possible. E.g
"   * if a setting can be effective when it only applies to a single filetype then
"   don't make the setting global
"   * prefer configuring coc in the coc-settings.json to here (we want this
"   file as small as possible)
" * custom library functions are defined in autoload scripts so that they are
" loaded on demand.
" * custom library function should never be silently overwritten with ! - this
" hides bugs
