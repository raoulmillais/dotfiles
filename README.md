# Just my dotfiles

My configuration files for unix systems. I use ArchLinux and cygwin
predominantly so consider all other systems untested.

## Requirements

archlinux
bash
screen
git
unicode terminal
htop
vim
postfix (or other Maildir format mail daemon)
screen

## Installation instructions

Symlink the files to your home directory.

## Here be dragons

These are customised to my personal preferences.  If you are an ArchLinux user
and hack in nodejs or JavaScript and use vim, then you may find these useful.
Either way, you should take time to read them before using them!

My vim configuration has now moved
